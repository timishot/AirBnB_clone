HBNB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, HTML/CSS templating, API, front-end and others.

This team project is part of the ALX School Software Engineering program.
It represents the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.

This first step consists of:

    a custom command-line interface for data management,
    and the base classes for the storage of this data.
